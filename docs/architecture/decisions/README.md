# Architecture Decision Records

Back to [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).

ADRs record **significant, hard-to-reverse** decisions and the forces behind them, so a later reader (human or
agent) knows *why* this repo is the way it is and *when* a decision should be reopened.

## Rules

- **One decision per ADR**, written from [`adr-template.md`](./adr-template.md).
- **Ids are collision-proof, not sequential:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>-<slug>.md`, the UTC authoring date plus six
  random hex characters (`openssl rand -hex 3`) plus a short slug. Never pick a "next number".
- **ADR before code.** A change that needs an ADR commits the ADR before the code that implements it, in the
  same PR ([documentation mandate](../../contributing/documentation-mandate.md)).
- **A merged ADR is `accepted`** — the reviewed merge is the acceptance. `proposed` only on a draft PR.
- **Immutable once on `main`.** Edit freely while the PR is open; after merge, change a decision only with a new
  ADR that supersedes or amends it, and update the old one's `Status` line to point at it.
- **Scope** names the module the decision governs: `bridge`, `server`, `plugin`, or `repo` (cross-cutting or
  governance).
- Enforced by [`scripts/check-docs.py`](../../../scripts/check-docs.py): filename shape, required header lines,
  no `proposed` on `main`, every ADR linked from this index.
